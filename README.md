==================================================================
This repository contains three scripts for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. The scipts include this README.md file, as well as the run_analysis R script and the CodeBook markdown file.

Two tidy data sets ('df' and 'df2') were created for the course project. These two datasets use data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Version 1). 

More description on the two tidy datasets created for this course project, as well as description on the source data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, are included in the files listed below. 

Description of files in the repository:
==================================================================

- 'README.md' : Overview of the scripts and files in the repository for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

- 'run_analysis.R': This file is a R script which includes the code to replicate the analyses and tidy data sets for the course project. The code is executed in eight steps, from the downloading and merging of the various datasets to the modification of these data frames to create tidy data sets which meet the specifications of the course project (descriptive labels, exctraction of select variables, creation of a second indpendent tidy data set). How the code execution works is descriped in much more detail in this R script.

- 'CodeBook.md' : This is a markdown file which describes the variables of the tidy dataset, the data and transformations to clean the data.
